# Example 1: Calculate Return on Equity (ROE)
net_profit = 1200  # in crores
shareholder_equity = 6000
roe = (net_profit / shareholder_equity) * 100  # %

# Example 2: PEG Ratio
pe_ratio = 15
earnings_growth = 12  # %
peg_ratio = pe_ratio / earnings_growth

# Example 3: Average EPS over 3 years
eps_1, eps_2, eps_3 = 22.5, 25.0, 27.5
avg_eps = (eps_1 + eps_2 + eps_3) / 3
